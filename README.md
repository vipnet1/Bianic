# What is it
A tool to help you with crypto rebalancing on Binance exchange.\
The idea is that you give Bianic read-only keys, and it monitors the coins for you & generates stats to help you do it manually fast.\
The aim is to preserve security by allowing keys to be read only, but to make rebalancing in investments easy task.

# Main Features
* Reports generation: Pages of stats to help you do the rebalancing and get information easily in general. Replacement for manual calculation via excel sheet.
* Coins monitoring in background: Bianic can monitor coins in background, and notify you once your threshold to rebalance is met.
* Time & Threshold rebalance:
    * Time rebalance: just enter bianic when you want, generate report and use it to rebalance easily without the need to do manual calculations.
    * Threshold rebalance: set your desired conditions, and activate coin monitoring. Bianic will notify you when it's time to rebalance, and will generate report for you so you can do it easily.
* Security: The keys are stored only on your device and can be configured as read only. This means that if someone steals them and they are read-only your funds are still safe.
  * Sure, the con is that you need to enter Binance and perform the rebalancing manually, using the generated report by Bianic.
